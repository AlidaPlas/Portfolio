The collection of music that I would like to learn more about are the songs of Sabrina Carpenter. I choose this artist, because I have been listening to her music for 7 years now and I am a big fan. I grew up with her, but she also did and her music has changed a lot over time. Sabrinaâ€™s first single came out in March 2014 when she was 14 years old. She is now 22 and in the mean time she released four albums and many singles.  
My comparison points will be the different albums of Sabrina Carpenter. I do think that there are differences, mainly in timbre and duration. I think that her volume and pitch stayed the same. But there are also some atypical 'Sabrina'songs and they might influence the results.
I am still not sure about my corpus, I might try to compare Sabrina Carpenter to the Sabrina Carpenter radio (artist radio from Spotify) and try to find comparisons in these songs.
